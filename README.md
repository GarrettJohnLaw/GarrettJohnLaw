  **Software Engineer** · AI Infrastructure · Backend Systems · Ships Fast

  I build AI infrastructure and applications that ship in weeks, not months.

  ## What I Do

  At Re:Build Manufacturing, I build backend systems and AI infrastructure: Terraform, observability, and CI/CD. I care about
  solving the actual problem, not building impressive architecture for its own sake.

  ## What I've Shipped

  **ReVA — AI Chatbot Infrastructure**
  - Built infrastructure from scratch: Terraform for multi-environment deployment, observability, and CI/CD
  - Improved RAG embedding speed by **20X** by replacing bottlenecks
  - Chose Open WebUI over custom frontend, reducing team from **6 to 2 developers**

  **Manufacturing Scheduler**
  - Built a finite scheduling application in **1 month** through daily customer meetings
  - Outperformed a vendor solution priced at **$30k/year**

  ## Tech Stack

  - **Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS (ECS, Lambda, Bedrock), CI/CD Pipelines
  - **Backend:** C# / .NET, TypeScript, GraphQL, REST APIs
  - **AI/ML:** LiteLLM, RAG Systems, AWS Bedrock
  - **Data:** PostgreSQL, DynamoDB
  - **Observability:** CloudWatch, custom metrics

  ## What I Care About

  - Solving the actual problem, not impressive architecture
  - Talking to customers, not just writing code
  - Simple solutions that work
  - Owning the full stack: application code, infrastructure, observability, CI/CD
